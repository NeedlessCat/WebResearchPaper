        <h2>Our Progress Report for now</h2>
        <p>
          As part of our project, we have made a little progress in enhancing
          the lecture videos by trying to remove the lecturer and making the
          entire visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the key steps we have undertaken so far (as per our
          understanding of the research paper provided by you) :
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none">
          <li>
            <h3>1) <u>Image Segmentation with Mask R-CNN</u></h3>
            <p>
              We have utilized a <b>pretrained model of Mask RCNN</b> to detect
              and segment the lecturer in the video frames. This is right now
              doing the <b>instance image segementation</b> of the frames. This
              model has proven effective in accurately identifying the
              lecturer's position within each frame.
            </p>
            <p>This generates a mask clip for the video frames as:</p>
            <video width="512" controls>
              <source src="clips/mask.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>
              We overlap the mask with the original video frame and segemented
              the lecturer as detected by the model.
            </p>
            <video width="512" controls>
              <source src="clips/imageseg.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2) <u>Background Restoration</u></h3>
            <p>
              After segmenting the lecturer, we have implemented
              <b>bitwise operations</b> to restore the background. This involves
              using the previous frame where the background is already processed
              and intact to overlap over the removed section of the current
              video frame. We have taken help from the research paper that you
              provided to implement this section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our output is not that satisfactory for now as you can see below:
            </p>
            <video width="512" controls>
              <source src="clips/output.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>
              This step is hoped to allow us to make the board fully visible,
              thereby enhancing the overall clarity and usefulness of the
              lecture videos. It is working partially as well and we are hoping
              to improve it more towards perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, we are currently fine-tuning the process to improve the
              accuracy and smoothness of the restored frames and we are
              confident that the final output will be of high quality.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><u>Improvements we are hoping to do</u></h3>
            <p>
              a) Implement the sementic segmentation inspite of instance
              segementation using Fast-SCNN to reduce the load.
            </p>
            <p>
              b) Train the model over some additional related dataset to get
              better outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>c) Work over the audio vanishing.</p>

              We would appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have to
              further improve our approach. Please let us know id you would like
              anything related to our work or if there is any specific areas you
              would like us to focus on.
